**Project: Delphi Wealth Management**

Welcome to the README for my project, Delphi Wealth Management. 
This web application showcases my skills in secure user authentication, data encryption, and access control. 
Below, I'll provide an overview of the project's features, technologies used, and how it demonstrates my abilities.

**Project Overview**

Delphi Wealth Management is a secure and user-friendly web application designed to manage bank accounts and transactions. 
The project demonstrates my proficiency in several key areas:

User Authentication: The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure user authentication and authorization.

Data Encryption: I've implemented asynchronous encryption using the JSEncrypt library, enhancing the security of transfering sensitive information.

Role-Based Access Control: The application employs different access privileges based on user roles, such as regular users and administrators.


**Features**

Secure Login: Users can securely log in using their account credentials.

Bank Transactions: Users can perform online transactions with confidence, knowing their data is encrypted.

Role-Specific Access: Different user roles have varying access to features and data.

Public Key Sharing: A public key endpoint ensures secure communication with the server.


**Technologies Used**


Node.js and Express: The application's backend is built using Node.js and Express, enabling robust server-side functionality.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT): JWTs are used for secure authentication and authorization.

JSEncrypt: I've integrated JSEncrypt to provide asynchronous encryption of sensitive data.

Cookies: Cookies are utilized for storing JWT tokens securely on the client side.


**How This Project Demonstrates My Skills**

Security Focus: The use of JWTs, encryption, and role-based access control showcases my commitment to creating secure applications.

Integration of Libraries: I effectively integrated external libraries, like cron, to perform repeated actions such as recurring transfers every month.

Full-Stack Proficiency: The combination of backend (Node.js, Express) and frontend (css, cookies, react) development demonstrates my full-stack capabilities.
